# Identifying-Deep-Fakes-in-Lung-Cancer-Imagery-Analysis
The increasing use of deep learning in medical imaging has raised concerns about the authenticity of diagnostic images,
particularly in lung cancer CT scans. Our work presents a novel
approach to address this concern by proposing a deep fake detection
system tailored specifically for lung cancer CT images. We curated
a comprehensive dataset comprising authentic scans alongside
synthesized deep fake images. Leveraging the Ensembled architecture, using two pre-trained deep learning models, DenseNet121
and VGG16, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN)
model to effectively discriminate between genuine and manipulated
CT scans. Our methodology incorporates advanced techniques
including data augmentation, transfer learning to enhance model
performance and generalization capabilities. We evaluated our
system using rigorous metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting deep fake
images in lung cancer CT scans.
